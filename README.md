# Shipbob Weight Audit :balance_scale:

> A tool to keep them "honest". :face_with_symbols_over_mouth:

I wrote this tool because I experienced (major) discrepancies in my own shipping weights. > For example, items that according to their own system weigh 9oz were shipped as 3lbs, a 5x > markup! :money_with_wings:

You can very easily try this on your own using just your PAT (Personal Access Token).

## Getting Started :rocket:

### Clone repository

To clone the repository, use the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wkasel/shipbob-weight-audit
cd shipbob-weight-audit
npm install
```

### Obtain Your Personal Access Token (PAT) :key:

1. Login to your Shipbob account.
2. Navigate to Integrations on the left-hand side.
3. Click on API Tokens.
4. Hit the big blue button on top titled Generate New Token.
5. Name your token and hit Save.

### Configure Your Environment :gear:

1. Rename the file .env.example to .env.
2. Open the .env file and replace YOUR_SHIPBOB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN with the token you generated in the previous step.

```sh

### Run the Audit :mag:

Now that everything is set up, it's time to run the audit and discover any overcharges.

```sh
npm run audit

```

This will execute the audit script, and you'll see a summary of the results in the console. Look out for the Overcharged Weight and Overcharged Percentage to see how much you've been overcharged.
